# LEGO-Compatible Ballast & Track System

This repository contains **LEGO-compatible ballast and track files** designed for 3D printing and use with custom or third-party LEGO-scale track systems.

The files are intended for **personal and club use**, allowing builders to print, modify, and adapt the parts to suit their layouts while maintaining LEGO geometry and spacing.

---

## 📦 What’s Included

### Ballast Files

* Straight and curved ballast plates
* Designed to sit **under or around compatible track**
* LEGO-compatible stud geometry for alignment and stability
* Optimized for modular layouts and large-radius curves

### Track Files

* Track sections sized to standard LEGO train geometry
* Curve radii and angles match the corresponding ballast pieces
* Intended to sit **flush into the ballast** (no clips or fasteners required)

> Ballast and track are designed as **separate components** so you can mix, match, or replace either without reprinting everything.

## 🧰 Printing Recommendations

### Filament

* **PLA or PLA+** recommended for ease of printing
* Dark grey, light grey, or ballast-style colors work best visually
* PETG is acceptable if your layout is exposed to heat, but expect slightly reduced detail

### Print Settings (Suggested)

* Layer height: **0.2 mm**
* Infill: **15–20%** (grid or gyroid)
* Walls: **3 perimeters**
* Top / Bottom layers: **4–5**
* No supports required

> Ballast pieces are designed to print **flat on the bed** for maximum strength and dimensional accuracy.

## 🧩 Assembly & Use

1. **Print the ballast pieces** needed for your layout
2. **Lay ballast on a flat surface** or baseplate
3. **Place track sections into the recessed areas** of the ballast
4. Align using LEGO studs, tiles, or surrounding scenery as desired

The track is held in place by:

* Gravity
* Tight tolerances
* Surrounding ballast geometry

No glue or permanent attachment is required unless you want a fixed layout.

## 🔧 Modifying the Files

You are encouraged to:

* Adjust radii or angles
* Add drainage, texture, or cosmetic details
* Integrate with baseplates, MILS, or custom supports
* Remix for club-specific standards

If you publish remixes, please:

* Credit the original source
* Clearly note what you changed

---

## 📏 Compatibility Notes

* Designed around **LEGO train geometry**
* Compatible with LEGO-scale rolling stock
* Intended to work alongside third-party track systems of matching radius
* Always test-fit with a short print before committing to a full layout
